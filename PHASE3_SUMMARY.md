# Phase 3 Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the features implemented in Phase 3 of the Rusty Sandbox project.

## 1. Advanced Resource Monitoring

### ResourceMonitor (`resources.rs`)
- Comprehensive resource tracking of CPU, memory, file descriptors, and network usage
- Real-time metrics collection with configurable thresholds
- Platform-specific implementations for Linux and macOS
- Support for setting resource limits and detecting limit violations
- Ability to track historical resource usage

### CGroups Integration (`cgroups.rs`)
- Comprehensive CGroup manager with support for both v1 and v2
- Support for multiple subsystems (CPU, memory, pids, etc.)
- Automatic detection of available CGroup version
- Process tracking and resource limiting using kernel capabilities
- Cleanup handling to ensure resources are properly released

## 2. Security Hardening

### Security Monitoring (`security.rs`)
- Security policy definitions with configurable security levels (Basic, Standard, Enhanced, Maximum)
- File access permissions with allowlists
- Network access controls with domain allowlists
- Process hierarchy monitoring and validation
- Fine-grained control over process capabilities

### Breach Detection (`security.rs`)
- Real-time security breach detection
- Classification of breach types (file access, network, process, etc.)
- Severity level assignment for security events
- Threshold-based alerting for suspicious activities
- Event aggregation for pattern detection

### Watchdog Service (`watchdog.rs`)
- Process monitoring for sandbox escape attempts
- Verification of namespace isolation on Linux
- Process hierarchy validation
- Automatic termination of breached sandboxes
- Platform-specific implementations for Linux and macOS

## 3. Telemetry System

### OpenTelemetry Integration (`telemetry.rs`)
- Comprehensive metrics collection for sandbox execution
- Tracing spans for detailed execution flow tracking
- Standardized event logging format
- Support for metrics export to external monitoring systems
- Security event recording and alerting

## 4. Cross-Platform Support

### macOS-Specific Features
- Resource monitoring using native macOS tools (ps, lsof, etc.)
- Process control mechanisms compatible with macOS security model
- Security monitoring tailored to macOS permissions system
- Alternative implementations when cgroups are not available

### Linux-Specific Features
- Enhanced security using kernel features (seccomp, namespaces)
- CGroup-based resource limiting
- Process isolation using Linux-specific security mechanisms
- Detailed process information via procfs

## 5. Monitoring Dashboard

### Terminal UI (`dashboard.rs`)
- Real-time resource monitoring with interactive dashboard
- Multiple views (resources, security, events)
- Historical resource usage graphs
- Process list and details
- Security event visualization
- Breach statistics and summaries

## Testing

A comprehensive test script (`test_phase3.sh`) is provided to validate the Phase 3 features:
- Resource-intensive workloads to test monitoring
- Security breach attempts to test detection mechanisms
- Cross-language testing (Python, JavaScript)
- Different security levels
- Dashboard visualization testing

## How to Use Phase 3 Features

### Command Line Options
- `--monitor`: Enable the monitoring dashboard
- `--security <level>`: Set security level (basic, standard, enhanced, maximum)
- Standalone monitoring: `rusty-sandbox monitor [--pid <PID>]`

### Dashboard Controls
- Tab: Switch between views
- Arrow keys: Navigate process list
- Q: Quit dashboard
- R: Refresh data
- A: Toggle auto-refresh

## Next Steps

While Phase 3 adds significant monitoring and security capabilities, some potential enhancements for future phases include:

1. Web-based monitoring dashboard
2. Distributed execution support
3. Machine learning for anomaly detection
4. Enhanced network sandboxing
5. Container integration (Docker, Podman)
