# Phase 2 Implementation: Multi-language & Extensibility

This document summarizes the changes made to implement Phase 2 of the Rusty Sandbox project, focusing on multi-language support and extensibility.

## üéØ Goals Achieved

1. **Plugin Architecture**
   - Created a modular execution system using Rust trait objects
   - Implemented `RuntimeExecutor` trait for language abstraction
   - Built a registry system for language runtime discovery

2. **Multi-language Support**
   - Refactored existing Python and JavaScript support into the plugin system
   - Added WebAssembly support using Wasmtime runtime
   - Created extension-to-runtime mapping for flexible file handling

3. **Configuration System**
   - Implemented a flexible TOML-based configuration system
   - Created a mechanism to specify sandbox policies
   - Added support for language-specific configurations

## üß© Architecture Changes

### Plugin System

The core of the plugin architecture is the `RuntimeExecutor` trait, which defines the interface for language-specific runtime implementations:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait RuntimeExecutor: Send + Sync {
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str;
    fn supported_extensions(&self) -> &[&'static str];
    fn lint_code(&self, content: &str) -> Result<()>;
    async fn execute(&self, file_path: &Path, policy: &SandboxPolicy) -> Result<ExecutionResult>;
}
```

This allows for:
- Easy addition of new language support
- Consistent interface for all runtimes
- Dynamic runtime selection based on file type

### Configuration System

The new configuration system uses a TOML-based approach, allowing users to:
- Specify resource limits
- Configure security settings
- Set language-specific options
- Define custom extension mappings

The configuration can be provided via:
- CLI argument (`--config`)
- Default locations (current directory, config directory, user config directory)

### WASM Support

Added full WebAssembly support:
- WASI-enabled runtime using Wasmtime
- Support for binary WASM and text WAT formats
- Custom resource limits for memory, instances, and table elements
- Stream capture for STDOUT/STDERR redirection
- File system isolation with controlled WASI preopen directories
- Network access control through configuration

## üîç Key Files Added/Modified

1. **New Files:**
   - `src/runtime.rs`: Core plugin architecture definitions
   - `src/runtimes/mod.rs`: Registry for language runtimes
   - `src/runtimes/python.rs`: Python executor implementation
   - `src/runtimes/javascript.rs`: JavaScript executor implementation
   - `src/runtimes/wasm.rs`: WebAssembly executor implementation
   - `src/config.rs`: Configuration system
   - `sandbox.toml`: Default configuration file
   - `examples/hello.wat`: Simple WebAssembly Text example
   - `examples/fibonacci.wat`: More complex WebAssembly example

2. **Modified Files:**
   - `src/main.rs`: Updated to use the new plugin architecture
   - `Cargo.toml`: Added new dependencies for WASM support
   - `README.md`: Updated documentation

## üî¨ WebAssembly Implementation Details

1. **Resource Limiting**
   - Implemented a custom `SandboxResourceLimiter` struct that enforces:
     - Maximum memory allocation
     - Maximum table elements
     - Maximum instance count

2. **WASI Integration**
   - Added WASI support with controlled file system access
   - Mapped allowed paths from configuration to WASI preopened directories
   - Captured STDOUT/STDERR through custom pipe implementations
   - Controlled network access based on policy settings

3. **WebAssembly Text Support**
   - Added support for `.wat` (WebAssembly Text) files
   - Implemented WAT-to-WASM conversion using the `wat` crate
   - Created example `.wat` files to demonstrate functionality

4. **Execution Safety**
   - Used Wasmtime's `Store` with epoch-based timeouts
   - Executed WASM in separate Tokio threads to prevent blocking
   - Applied consistent timeout mechanisms
   - Handled WASM errors with proper error reporting

## üìù Future Improvements

1. **WASM Enhancement**
   - Implement WASM module validation before execution
   - Add more fine-grained WASI capability control
   - Support WebAssembly Component Model when stable

2. **Additional Languages**
   - Add support for Rust, Go, and other languages
   - Implement language-specific security profiles

3. **Configuration Enhancements**
   - Add validation for configuration values
   - Support for profiles (development, production, etc.)
   - Runtime-specific seccomp profiles

4. **Testing**
   - Create comprehensive tests for each runtime
   - Benchmark different language runtimes
   - Security testing for isolation mechanisms
